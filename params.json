{"name":"Cell","tagline":"Colour/Sudoku like puzzle game","body":"Cell\r\n====\r\n\r\nColour/Sudoku like puzzle game.\r\n\r\nThis is Cell, it is the product of ~8-10 hours of work, and my first ever properly finished, wholly-coded by me game!\r\n\r\nIt's a simple, but also difficult puzzle game. To win, simply change the colours of each cell by clicking on them.\r\nSome cells can change to more colours than others, currently you have to work out which cells support which colours.\r\nWhen every cell has either the same colour, or an adjacent colour (check the colour chart at the bottom) to its \r\nneighbouring cells, the game widens.\r\n\r\nYou win when you have correctly filled the entire window.\r\n\r\nThe current version includes a cheat - simply click anywhere on the menu bar at the bottom to show a solution.\r\nThere is always guaranteed to be at least one solution, however beware that what worked for a 4x4 grid may not\r\napply when the grid widens to 8x8.\r\n\r\nHope you have fun, and I aim to add more features in the near future.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
