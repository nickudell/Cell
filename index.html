<p>Colour/Sudoku like puzzle game.</p>

<p>This is Cell, it is the product of ~8-10 hours of work, and my first ever properly finished, wholly-coded by me game!</p>

<p>It's a simple, but also difficult puzzle game. To win, simply change the colours of each cell by clicking on them.
Some cells can change to more colours than others, currently you have to work out which cells support which colours.
When every cell has either the same colour, or an adjacent colour (check the colour chart at the bottom) to its 
neighbouring cells, the game widens.</p>

<p>You win when you have correctly filled the entire window.</p>

<p>The current version includes a cheat - simply click anywhere on the menu bar at the bottom to show a solution.
There is always guaranteed to be at least one solution, however beware that what worked for a 4x4 grid may not
apply when the grid widens to 8x8.</p>

<p>Hope you have fun, and I aim to add more features in the near future.</p>
